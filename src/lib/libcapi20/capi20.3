.Sh DESCRIPTION
.
.
The functions described in this manual make up the CAPI implementation
for user space applications in the BSD operating system
environment. They are implemented in the shared library
.Nm libcapi20 .
The functions are largely compatible with the CAPI specification for
other operating systems. There are only minor differences.
.
.
.
.Pp
.
.Fn capi20_register
will create a new CAPI application ID. It returns zero on success. The
application ID is stored in the 32-bit unusigned integer pointed to by
.Fa app_id_ptr .
.
.
.
.Pp
.
.Fn capi20_release
will release the CAPI application identified by
.Fa app_id
and all resources and active calls associated with it. It returns zero
on success.
.
.
.
.Pp
.
.Fn capi20_put_message
will send a message for the CAPI application identified by
.Fa app_id .
.Fa buf_ptr
is a pointer to the CAPI message that should be sent. If this function
returns non-zero, the application should release its ID and restart.
.
.
.
.Pp
.
.Fn capi20_get_message
will receive a message for the CAPI application identified by
.Fa app_id .
It returns zero on success. If there are no message and non-blocking
operation is selected, 0x1104 will be returned. Else there is a critical
error and the application should release its ID and restart.
.Fa buf_pp
is a pointer to a pointer that should be pointed to the start of the
received CAPI message.
.
.
.
.Pp
.
.Fn capi20_wait_for_message 
will wait until there is a message for the CAPI application identified by
.Fa app_id .
If 
.Fa timeval_ptr
is not NULL, it will return after that time has elapsed. Zero is
returned on success.
.
.
.
.Pp
.
.Fn capi20_get_manufacturer
will store the manufacturer name as a zero terminated string, for the
CAPI controller identified by
.Fa controller,
in the buffer pointed to by
.Fa buf_ptr
which has length
.Fa buf_len.
Default length is 64 bytes. Zero is returned on success.
.
.
.
.Pp
.
.Fn capi20_get_version
will store the CAPI version as a series of bytes, for the CAPI
application identified by
.Fa app_id,
in the buffer pointed to by
.Fa buf_ptr
which has length
.Fa buf_len.
Zero is returned on success.
.
.
.
.Pp
.
.Fn capi20_get_serial_number
will store the CAPI serial number as a zero terminated string, for
the application identified by
.Fa app_id, 
in the buffer pointed to by
.Fa buf_ptr
which has length
.Fa buf_len.
Default length is 4 bytes. Zero is returned on success.
.
.
.
.Pp
.
.Fn capi20_get_profile
will store the CAPI profile structure, for the application identified
by
.Fa app_id, 
in the buffer pointed to by
.Fa buf_ptr
which has length
.Fa buf_len. 
Default length is 64 bytes. Note that the CAPI profile structure uses
little endian byte order. To decode fields use "le16toh()" and
"le32toh()". Zero is returned on success. Also see CAPI_PROFILE_DATA
in
.Pa capi20.h .
.
.
.
.Pp
.
.Fn capi20_fileno
will return the file number for the CAPI application identified by
.Fa app_id .
The file number returned can be used for polling. It is also possible
to use the ioctl "FIONBIO" to set or clear non-blocking behaviour. An
integer greater than zero is returned on success.
.
.
.
.
.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.
.
Definition of CAPI messages and related structures are defined in the header file
.Pa capi20.h .
To make implementing CAPI easier, there has been defined as set of
helper functions that will encode and decode CAPI messages into
predefined structures. These are for example
.Fn capi_get_message_decoded
and
.Fn capi_put_message_decoded
 . See also "struct capi_message_decoded". By default all encoded CAPI
structures use little endian byte order.
.
.
.
.
.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.
.
Nearly all functions return a 16-bit unsigned integer value as a
direct function result.
.Fn capi_get_error_string()
will return a zero terminated string that describes the return
value. In general a return value of zero means no error.

.Sh STANDARDS
The functions described in this manual page largely comply with the
currently existing CAPI specification. Not all features of the CAPI
specification have been implemented.
